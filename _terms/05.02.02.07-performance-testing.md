fundamental_description: |
    Performance testing verifies that the software meets the specified performance requirements. Scalability testing assesses the softwareâ€™s ability to scale up non-functional requirements such as load, number of transactions, volume of data. It could integrate or extend load, elasticity and stress testing.

# Text, a brief description of the typical realizations of the fundamental, in RSE practice
rse_practice: "Performance testing verifies that the software obtains suitable performance on the target systems.  Scalability testing ensures that the software can be parallelized across a suitable number of computer nodes. Many software developers will pay some attention to performance and scalability; fewer will explicitly perform tests separate from monitoring the performance/scalability of science runs."
