agent that decides whether the system under test behaved correctly. If the oracle cannot decide, the test output is classified as inconclusive."

In this case, we believe that RSEs are mostly not familiar with the SWEBOK term "the oracle problem", but are very aware of the need to have a source of truth for their tests.  So in the current assessment, we've interpreted `rse_awareness` to focus specifically on the term, while agreeing that RSEs are widely aware and widely using the *concept* at a practical level.
