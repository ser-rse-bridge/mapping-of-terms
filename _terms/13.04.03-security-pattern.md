# Short (1 sentence) description of the SE fundamental -- as a convenience
fundamental_description: "A security pattern describes a particular recurring security problem that arises in a specific context and presents a well-proven generic solution."

    - Security pattern (tentative)

# Text, a brief description of the typical realizations of the fundamental, in RSE practice
rse_practice: "Many RSEs will have a general understanding of `patterns' as a concept and will accept that security patterns exist, but few will actually be familiar with them."
